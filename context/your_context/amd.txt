AMD
AN AMD Ryzen CPU. The gold triangle in the bottom left assists with alignment during insertion. As seen here, most AMD CPUs use pins that insert into a socket on the motherboard, which is the opposite of Intel platforms, which feature pins on the motherboard.
Recent AMD Ryzen CPUs use a naming scheme that is different than, but similar to Intel's. AMD and Intel now both use the 3/5/7/9 series CPU classification, with AMD not using an "i" prefix. Ryzen processors increase in price as the last three numbers increase.

The TDP of a processor gives an idea of how much power would it consume in a standard heavy use scenario.
But note that it does not give the absolute maximum power it would consume. For instance , if you try to stress your CPU by running Prime95(a popular CPU stressing tool) or something of that sort , it is likely to exceed the TDP rating(atleast for a short period of time , this depends on the cooling efficiency.)
In some cases , it can nearly be the double. For instance , a MacBook Air with 15W TDP can hit up to 29W when running graphics-heavy workloads.
The TDP in a laptop is lower than a desktop , because laptops have space and battery requirements.
